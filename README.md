 About the Project
The goal was to create a simple yet functional app for a food vendor, allowing users to:

Browse a menu (Pizza 🍕, Burger 🍔, Noodles 🍜).

Order multiple items in custom quantities.

View a detailed receipt with itemized costs and a total price.

Validate user inputs to prevent errors (e.g., invalid choices, negative quantities).

The app uses Python and core programming concepts like dictionaries, loops, and modular functions to deliver a seamless experience.
